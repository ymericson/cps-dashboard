        <h1>Chicago Public High School Graduation Rates</h1>
        <p>
          Chicago Public Schools reached record-breaking 5-year graduation rates for the <a href='https://www.cps.edu/press-releases/mayor-lightfoot-and-chicago-public-schools-announce-record-high-graduation-rate/#:~:text=Lightfoot%20and%20Chicago%20Public%20Schools%20(CPS)%20CEO%20Jackson%20announced%20today,academic%20progress%20of%20Latinx%20students.'>2019-2020</a> school year. Despite all schools finishing the academic year in a remote learning format, the school system's graduation rate ended up at 83.5 percent in 2020. CPS also achieved the lowest dropout rate - the percent of students who drop out over a course of a given year - of 5.6 percent, a decrease from 6.0 percent a year before. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, Chicagoâ€™s graduation rate has risen nearly 27 percentage points from 2010 when only 55.8 percent of CPS students earned a diploma. These school metrics have been propelled by an increase in total expenditure (instruction, administration, support services) in the last decade, along with the academic improvements of Hispanic and Black students.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Chicago still falls short of meeting <a href='https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_coi.asp'>national</a> and <a href='https://www.illinoisreportcard.com/state.aspx?source=trends&source2=graduationrate&Stateid=IL'>state</a> averages, and the numbers show persistent racial gaps between students. The schools that reported the lowest 5-year graduation rates include several neighborhood schools on the South and West sides that have gone through consolidations or closings, as well as several that have struggled with dwindling enrollment.
